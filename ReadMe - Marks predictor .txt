Hi User!

This is a marks predictor created by Anirudh Sengar a student at gems millennium school sharjah.
The exam pattern in my school is as follows,
Cycle test 1 (0.16 of a grade)
Cycle test 2 (0.32 of a grade)
Mid term exam (0.5 of a grade)
Cycle test 3 (0.66 of a grade)
Cycle test 4 (0.82 of a grade)
Annual Exam ( 1 ie completed the grade)

This learns the learning pattern through the previously achieved marks and predicts their future marks.
